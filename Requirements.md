C#.NET Core – Technical Test


Introduction:
The purpose of this task is to assess your expertise, knowledge, and style of coding based on a number of important skill sets. We have created a simple scenario that will help us understand your level of proficiency.
 
Objective
Design and create a Web API project that will connect with a 3rd party foreign exchange data provider (Open Exchange Rates) to convert a dollar amount from one currency to another based on the currency type requested (ie. CDN or USD). Log & read something to & from the DB. What that save/read doesn’t matter - we want to see your implementation. The application should have a basic test project to showcase your testing knowledge. 


Review and Assessment:
We are looking to see your use of the following technologies and/or libraries. The project should include at least one case of each.
AutoMapper
Dependency Injection (DI)
Factory pattern
DRY, SOLID, Clean Architecture, Service/Repository patterns
MSTest2 (or other c# .net testing framework) 
At least 1 or 2 unit tests are requested
You can write in point form what additional unit tests you would need to write to ensure the code is solid.
AutoFixture & Mock
Code-first migration
Entity Framework (EF) 
LINQ
Refit (or c# equivalent/alternative)
RESTful API


Bonus Points:
Adding these items to your project will score you loads more points and really showcase why we need to work with you.
Swagger
ProblemDetails
Postman collection




Additional evaluation notes:
DRY, SOLID, Service/Repo, and/or any other patterns you deem appropriate
Naming convention for methods, variables, endpoints, etc
How you connect to the 3rd party API
How you’ve built the Web API controller & endpoints
Coding style





Requirements
Visual Studio 2022 (Minimum - Community/Free)
Use OpenExchangeRates as your API EndPoint (https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/latest-json)
API Key: 041f13216f7840fbbeb5d9828390ce51



Deliverables
Web API Project containing all the above items



Additional Info
We're looking to see how you break up this project, how clean, reusable, and readable your code is, and how you go about designing the interactions with this class.
As a developer at Secureship, you will be allowed to use any LLM to help you with your code generation and speed of development. Therefore, for this task, you are allowed to use ChatGPT (or others) to assist you in the completion of this task.
Note that you do need to have the technical skills to explain the code you have put together.
